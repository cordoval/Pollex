Actuall this project is only an unfinished API documentation.
But the goal is to bring it up to a generic tool for creating and analyzing polls.
Because of the fact, that this project is only a __RESTfull__ interface we need
some help from peoples which have ideas for nice frontend.
In the documentation folder are mockups for the most actions you can perform on this API,
so first client should be simple to realize, which meens, you are free to do this ;)
The full documentation, wrapped in a nice design, is availeaable under (http://newloki.github.com/Pollex).
